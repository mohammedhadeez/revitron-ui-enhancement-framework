## üìö **Documentation Standards**

### Documentation Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate documentation:

1. **API Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public methods
2. **Usage Examples**: Practical examples for new features
3. **Configuration Documentation**: Any new configuration options
4. **Performance Documentation**: Impact on system performance

### Documentation Style

```python
def validate_comprehensive_coverage(
    self,
    suggestions: List[Dict], 
    implementation_specs: List[Dict]
) -> ComprehensiveValidationReport:
    """
    Execute 100% validation coverage across all suggestions and criteria.
    
    This method ensures every suggestion is validated against every criterion,
    addressing the critical issue of incomplete validation coverage identified
    in the self-reflection analysis.
    
    Args:
        suggestions: List of button suggestions to validate. Each suggestion
            must contain 'id', 'name', 'functionality', and 'description' keys.
        implementation_specs: Corresponding implementation specifications with
            'suggestion_id' and 'completeness_score' at minimum.
            
    Returns:
        ComprehensiveValidationReport containing detailed validation results
        with 100% coverage verification, quality metrics, and recommendations.
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If 100% coverage cannot be achieved or if input
            data is malformed.
            
    Example:
        >>> validator = ValidationEngine(config)
        >>> suggestions = [{'id': '1', 'name': 'Test', ...}]
        >>> specs = [{'suggestion_id': '1', 'completeness_score': 0.9}]
        >>> report = validator.validate_comprehensive_coverage(suggestions, specs)
        >>> assert report.validation_coverage == 1.0  # 100% coverage
        
    Performance:
        O(n*m) where n=suggestions and m=validation_criteria.
        Typical execution: 50 suggestions in <10 seconds.
        
    Self-Reflection Fix:
        This addresses Critical Issue #2: "Only validated 20% of content"
        by implementing mandatory 100% validation coverage.
